# FluidSim
Simple Python Fluid Simulator.
Use this Repo to gather a basic understanding of water simulations, although not complex it works and is very simple.
Currently only supports water and stone placement.

- The water interacts with stone, flowing down paths etc.
- Simple and short
- Written in Python so it's easy to follow.
